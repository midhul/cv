## 4-bit Multi-cycle processor on breadboards 

Lab Project (April 2015)

We handcrafted a 4-bit Processor architecture with a custom instruction set and built a working processor based on it from scratch. It took 6+ breadboards, several hundreds of wires and a hell lot of patience to get it working. The Datapath was mainly made up of registers, counters, ALU and a RAM chip all wired to the data and address buses using tri-state buffers. Microcode for the control unit's state machine was programmed into EEPROM chips using special equipment.
