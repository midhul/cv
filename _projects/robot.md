## Autonomous Maze Solving Robot

_International Autonomous Robotics Competition (iARC), TechKritiâ€™14, IIT Kanpur_ (March 2014)

I worked in a team of 4 members to build and program an autonomous line following robot which is capable of solving arbitrary loop-less mazes and returning to the start point in the shortest possible path.
The bot was placed _4th in the international round_ of the iARC competition held during TechKriti 2014 at IIT Kanpur.

The following is a video demonstration of the robot:
