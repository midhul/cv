## Classroom Voice Amplification System 

_TechEvince 1.0, IIT Guwahati_ (October 2013)

Built a prototype system which enables students sitting at the back of large classrooms or lecture halls interact with the teacher/professor using their smartphones. A script capable of running on Android devices allows students to speak into the microphone of their mobile. This voice is sent to a central system and amplified through speakers on approval of the teacher/professor.
