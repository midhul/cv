--Mobile Agent based Intelligent Tutoring System  June'15 - Present (ongoing)
Dr. Shivashankar B. Nair (Summer project)
The goal of the project is to build a mobile agent based system which operates on a network of laptops in a large classroom/workshop, and enables the instructor(s) to effectively monitor the progress of students and provide them assistance.
* Implemented a basic framework for the system using the SWI-Prolog based Tartarus Mobile Agent platform, which was developed at the CSE robotics lab, IIT Guwahati
* Built GUI applications to visualize emulation of the system using Electron (node.js based framework for desktop applications)  


--Vehicle Management System (mobile & web app)
Dr. P.K. Das
* Worked in a team of 20 students to build a vehicle management system which provides various facilities such as theft reporting, parking availability and bus timings to vehicle owners and security personnel through web and android applications.
* Designed and implemented a RESTful API on the server side using Django REST framework, and supporting client side library for the Android platform.

--All-JS : Assembler,Linker,Loader & Simulator
Dr. Santosh Biswas
[Link to repo]
* Implemented a two-pass assembler, linker, loader and simulator for a subset of the 8085 micro-processor instruction set, all in pure javascript.
* All the entities were coupled into a single page interactive user interface which shows the process step by step and runs directly on the browser with no other dependencies.
